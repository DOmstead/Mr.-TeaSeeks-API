Gold needle grade generally accounts for less than 0.5% of a fermentation batch, and is usually used sparingly to smooth out blends before pressing. Finding loose gold needle grade shu Pu-Erh is exceedingly difficult because of this. Our Huron Gold Needle is the silkiest tea we have ever tasted.

There is nothing of the astringency one might expect in a younger sheng like this one. The promising smoothness delivers and builds upon itself in later steepings, with the velvety spice that a Yunnan Golden Needle might have, complimented by an ever-stronger cedar wood flavor.
