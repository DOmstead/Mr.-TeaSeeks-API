# Mr. TeaSeeks

### I'm Mr. TeaSeeks, look at me! Let me help you find your Tea!


Mr. TeaSeeks is a fullstack app that utilizes Javascript, React, Express, Node, HTML5, CSS3, and PostgreSQL to create a unique user experience. It allows users to input some basic criteria, and then be provided with teas that meet that criteria from our database. This can help users discover new and interesting teas with which to enrich their lives.

This Git is for the backend/API portion of the application. A link to the live app and the frontend portion of this app can be found below.
